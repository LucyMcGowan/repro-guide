# The JASA Reproducibility Guide

For manuscripts initially submitted as of July 1, 2021, all submitted *revisions* must include code and data to reproduce the work presented, as well as our Author Contributions Checklist (ACC) form documenting the materials. We encourage, but do not require, authors to provide materials upon initial submission.

These web pages provide guidance on reproducibility for authors and reviewers in JASA. 

## Guidance for authors

1. In preparing your materials, please see our [guidelines for authors](pages/author-guidelines), which is also provided in [JASA's instructions for authors](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?show=instructions&journalCode=uasa20).
2. Authors must fill out the [ACC form](pages/acc.html), documenting the reproducibility of their work. 
3. Feel free to look at previously published articles for example reproducible materials. Reproducibility materials for previously published articles are available at [https://github.com/jasa-acs](https://github.com/jasa-acs). We particularly recommend the reproducibility materials in the following articles:
   - [example 1](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Value-of-Information-Sensitivity-Analysis-and-Research-Design-in-Bayesian-Evidence-Synthesis)
   - [example 2](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Modeling-Bronchiolitis-Incidence-Proportions-in-the-Presence-of-Spatio-Temporal-Uncertainty)
   - [example 3](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Penalized-and-Constrained-Optimization-An-Application-to-High-Dimensional-Website-Advertising)
   - [example 4](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Quantile-Function-on-Scalar-Regression-Analysis-for-Distributional-Data)

## Guidance for reviewers

An Associate Editor (AE) will assign each revised manuscript sent out to review, at least one "Reproducibility Reviewer" (RR). In many cases, the AE may simply request that one of the Associate Editors for Reproducibility serve as the Reproducibility Reviewer, by assigning the "generic" Reproducibility Reviewer. 

1. Please see our [guidelines for reviewers](pages/reviewer-guidelines) when reviewing a manuscript for reproducibility.
2. We ask that reproducibility reviewers consider [these review criteria](pages/review-form) and ideally explicitly fill out a review form (simply create a document with the headers as given in that link) and include the completed form as an attachment with your review.

## General resources on reproducibility

Various journals are now requiring or strongly encouraging authors to provide code and data to reproduce their work. In addition, many researchers have written guidance on best practices for reproducibility. These are just a few of the many resources you may find online.

1. [Guidance from a group of reproducibility (aka 'data') editors of social science journals](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance).
2. The American Economic Association requires code and data for all submissions to the AEA journals. Here is [guidance from the AEA data editor](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance).

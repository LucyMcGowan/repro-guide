# The JASA Reproducibility Guide

For manuscripts initially submitted as of July 1, 2021, all submitted *revisions* must include code and data to reproduce the work presented, as well as our Author Contributions Checklist (ACC) form documenting the materials. We encourage, but do not require, authors to provide materials upon initial submission.

These web pages provide JASA's official guidance on reproducibility for authors and reviewers. 

## Guidance for authors

1. Authors must fill out the [ACC form](pages/acc.html), documenting the reproducibility of their work. The form includes specific information about what reproducibility materials and instructions authors are expected to provide.
2. Authors who would like more detail than is provided in the ACC form or would like to see the guidance in document form can also see our [guidelines for authors](pages/author-guidelines).
3. Feel free to look at previously published articles for examples of reproducibility materials. Reproducibility materials for previously published articles are available at [https://github.com/jasa-acs](https://github.com/jasa-acs). We particularly recommend the reproducibility materials in the following articles:
   - [example 1](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Value-of-Information-Sensitivity-Analysis-and-Research-Design-in-Bayesian-Evidence-Synthesis)
   - [example 2](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Modeling-Bronchiolitis-Incidence-Proportions-in-the-Presence-of-Spatio-Temporal-Uncertainty)
   - [example 3](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Penalized-and-Constrained-Optimization-An-Application-to-High-Dimensional-Website-Advertising)
   - [example 4](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Quantile-Function-on-Scalar-Regression-Analysis-for-Distributional-Data)

## Guidance for reviewers

An Associate Editor (AE) will assign each revised manuscript sent out to review, at least one "Reproducibility Reviewer" (RR). In most cases, the Reproducibility Reviewer will be one of the Associate Editors for Reproducibility (who the AE may request simply by assigning the "generic" Reproducibility Reviewer. 

1. Please see our [guidelines for reviewers](pages/reviewer-guidelines) when reviewing a manuscript for reproducibility.
2. We ask that reproducibility reviewers consider [these review criteria](pages/review-form) and ideally explicitly fill out a review form (simply create a document with the headers as given in that link) and include the completed form as an attachment with your review.

## General resources on reproducibility

Various journals are now requiring or strongly encouraging authors to provide code and data to reproduce their work. In addition, many researchers have written guidance on best practices for reproducibility. These are just a few of the many resources you may find online.

1. [Guidance from a group of reproducibility (aka 'data') editors of social science journals](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance).
2. The American Economic Association requires code and data for all submissions to the AEA journals. Here is [guidance from the AEA data editor](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance).
3. PLOS Computational Biology requires code be publicly shared. Here are [the PLOS Computational Biology requirements and guidance](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/code-availability).

## Help

Please contact the Associate Editors for Reproducibility at [jasa.app.cs.aer@gmail.com](mailto:jasa.app.cs.aer@gmail.com) with any questions when filling out the ACC form, or questions about the guidelines for authors or for reviewers, or if you are interested in learning more about our reproducibility initiative.

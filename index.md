# The JASA Reproducibility Guide

As of September 2016, all submissions to JASA Applications and Case Studies must include code, data, and the workflow to reproduce the work presented.

As of September 2021, all **invited revisions** to JASA (both Applications & Case Studies and Theory & Methods) for manuscripts whose initial submission was on or after September 1, 2021, must include code, data, and the workflow to reproduce the work presented. We encourage but do not require that initial submissions include the code, data, and workflow.

These web pages provide guidance on reproducibility for authors and reviewers in JASA. 

## Guidance for authors

1. In preparing your materials, please see our [guidelines for authors](pages/author-guidelines).
2. Authors must fill out the [ACC form](pages/acc.html), documenting the reproducibility of their work. 
3. Feel free to look at previously published articles for example reproducible materials. All reproducibility materials for published articles (those submitted as of September 2016) are available at [https://github.com/jasa-acs](https://github.com/jasa-acs). We particularly recommend the reproducibility materials in the following articles:
   - [example 1](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Value-of-Information-Sensitivity-Analysis-and-Research-Design-in-Bayesian-Evidence-Synthesis)
   - [example 2](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Modeling-Bronchiolitis-Incidence-Proportions-in-the-Presence-of-Spatio-Temporal-Uncertainty)
   - [example 3](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Penalized-and-Constrained-Optimization-An-Application-to-High-Dimensional-Website-Advertising)
   - [example 4](https://github.com/jasa-acs/Quantile-Function-on-Scalar-Regression-Analysis-for-Distributional-Data)

## Guidance for reproducibility reviewers

While an associate editor may ask one of the reviewers to review a given manuscript for reproducibility, in most cases one of the JASA associate editors for reproducibility (AER) is asked to carry out this review (by selecting the generic 'reviewer for reproducibility' in the review system. 

1. Please see our [guidelines for reviewers](pages/reviewer-guidelines) when reviewing a manuscript for reproducibility.
2. We ask that reproducibility reviewers consider [these review criteria](pages/review-form) and ideally explicitly fill out a review form (simply create a document with the headers as given in that link) and include the completed form as an attachment with your review.

## General resources on reproducibility

Various journals are now requiring or strongly encouraging authors to provide code and data to reproduce their work. In addition, many researchers have written guidance on best practices for reproducibility. These are just a few of the many resources you may find online.

1. [Guidance from a group of reproducibility (aka 'data') editors of social science journals](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance).
2. The American Economic Association requires code and data for all submissions to the AEA journals. Here is [guidance from the AEA data editor](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance).

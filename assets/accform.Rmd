<!--HOW TO COMPLETE THIS FORM:-->

<!-- 
1. This is a Markdown document, which requires an interpreter to compile into its final version form. RStudio can compile Markdown documents, as can other open-source tools [provide more detail here].  -->
<!-- 
In your submission, please include: -->
<!-- 
a) This file (with extension .Rmd or .md)  -->
<!-- 
b) A compiled version of this form in PDF or .docx format 
-->

<!-- 
2. Checkboxes in this document appear as follows: -->
<!-- 
- [ ] This is a checkbox -->
<!-- 
To check a checkbox, replace [ ] by [x], as follows: -->
<!-- 
- [x] This is a checked checkbox -->

<!-- 
3. For text answers, simply type the relevant text in the areas indicated. A blank line starts a new paragraph. -->

<!-- 
4. Comments (like these instructions) provide additional instructions throughout the form. There is no need to remove them; they will not appear in the compiled document. -->

<!-- 
5. If you are comfortable with Markdown syntax, you may choose to include any Markdown-compliant formatting in the form. For example, you may wish to include R code chunks and compile this document in R Markdown.  -->

<!-- 
6. If you have any problems completing this form, please contact jasa.app.cs.aer@gmail.com  -->

The purpose of the Author Contributions Checklist (ACC) Form is to document the artifacts associated with a manuscript (i.e., the data and code supporting the computational findings) and describe how to reproduce the findings. The final version of this document is included as online supplemental material with the published paper and on the JASA Github site (http://github.com/JASA-ACS/) and is referenced in the abstract.


ACC forms for published papers can be seen in the Supplementary Materials section of each paper on the JASA website, as well as within the README file of each paper's JASA GitHub repository (http://github.com/JASA-ACS/). Examples of high-quality reproducibility materials are provided at YYYYYYYYYYYYYY.

# Data

- [ ] This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).

### Publicly available data

<!--
If the data for this manuscript are not publicly available, skip to the Non-publicly available section below. Otherwise, continue.
-->

- [ ] Data are available online at:

- [ ] Data are available as part of the paperâ€™s supplementary material.

- [ ] Data are publicly available by request, following the process described here:

- [ ] Data are or will be made available through some other mechanism, described below:

### Non-publicly available data

<!--
If the data for this manuscript are publicly available, skip to the Description section below. Otherwise, complete this section
-->

The Journal of the American Statistical Association requires authors to make data accompanying their papers available to the scientific community except in cases where: 1) public sharing of data would be impossible, 2) suitable synthetic data are provided which allow the main analyses to be replicated (recognizing that results may differ from the "real" data analyses), and 3) the scientific value of the results and methods outweigh the lack of reproducibility.

Discussion of lack of publicly available data:
-	why data sharing is not possible,
-	what synthetic data are provided, and 
-	why the value of the paper's scientific contribution outweighs the lack of reproducibility.
